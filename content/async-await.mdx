# async/await: A Modern Romance

Remember callback hell? Those pyramids of doom,  
Where `.then()` and `.catch()` filled every room,  
Indentation growing deeper with each nested call,  
We promised ourselves we'd escape it all.

Then you arrived, `async` and `await`,  
Two keywords that would seal our fate,  
You made asynchronous code read top to bottom,  
Like synchronous code, but you never fought 'em.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  const user = await getUser()
  const posts = await getPosts(user.id)
  const comments = await getComments(posts)
  return comments
}
```

Look at that beauty! Sequential and clear,  
No more callbacks nested, no more fear,  
Error handling? Just `try` and `catch`,  
Our code is now clean, a perfect match.

The old way haunts us in legacy code,  
Those `.then()` chains, that heavy load,  
But in new projects, you reign supreme,  
async/await, you're the team's dream.

Some say Promises were fine on their own,  
But you gave us syntax that feels like home,  
So here's to you, syntactic sugar sweet,  
Making async code a pure treat.

_Note: This poem `await`s your appreciation._
