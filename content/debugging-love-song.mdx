# console.log: A Debugging Love Song

O faithful friend in times of need,  
When bugs arise and errors plead,  
You light the path through code so dark,  
With simple text, you leave your mark.

No fancy tools or IDE,  
Just `console.log()` and me,  
We track the data, watch it flow,  
And slowly, surely, come to know.

"Is it undefined?" we cry,  
You answer with a truthful sigh,  
You never judge, you never shame,  
You just print out the value name.

The senior dev may roll their eyes,  
"Use debuggers!" they advise,  
But you and I both know the truth:  
There's beauty in simplicity, forsooth.

So here's to you, my trusted guide,  
Through callback hell and async ride,  
When production breaks at 3 AM,  
I'll `console.log()` again.

Forever logged,  
A grateful dev
