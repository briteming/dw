# The Great Semicolon Wars: A Ballad

In the land of JavaScript, where frameworks rise and fall,  
There raged a bitter conflict that divided one and all,  
Some warriors stood for semicolons, declared them good and right,  
While others scorned such symbols and would argue through the night.

"ASI will save us all!" one faction proudly cried,  
"The parser adds them for us, there's nothing left to hide!"  
But traditionalists would counter with a grimace and a frown,  
"Explicit is better! Don't let standards let us down!"

The code reviews grew heated, the pull requests grew long,  
Each side convinced completely that the other side was wrong,  
The senior dev said semi-yes, the junior said semi-no,  
The merge conflicts grew legendary, deploys were getting slow.

Then came a hero from the east, with auto-format in hand,  
"Just pick a style!" they thundered, "And format all the land!"  
They installed Prettier swiftly, committed `.prettierrc`,  
And suddenly the arguing was just a fading spark.

Now no one fights in standups about semicolons anymore,  
The CI checks the formatting before it hits the door,  
The team found peace and harmony, their velocity increased,  
And all it took was automating what had caused this bitter feast.

**Moral:** Sometimes the best solution  
Is to stop the debate,  
Let robots handle formatting,  
And ship before it's late.
